  "summary": "Procrustes-based DefensiveToken transfer is effective. Both transfer directions (Llama-3.1→3 and Llama-3→3.1) achieve strong success (gap-closed ratio r >= 0.85) with utility fully preserved (RefusalRate 0.0-0.5%) and compute savings of 133-285x vs full optimization. The forward direction (3.1→3) achieves 0.0% ASR with zero GPU compute (CPU-only Procrustes alignment). The reverse direction (3→3.1) requires a lightweight 7-minute fine-tuning of 5 token embeddings to reach 1.9% ASR, matching measured Full DefensiveTokens performance.",
  "analysis": "Criterion 1 (Security Gap Closure): Direction 3.1→3 achieves r=1.01 (strong success, ASR=0.0%). Direction 3→3.1 achieves r=0.52 with Procrustes only (partial success, ASR=33.7%) but r=0.98 after tiny-adapt (strong success, ASR=1.9%). Both final results beat all prompting baselines (Reminder, Sandwich). Criterion 2 (Utility Preservation): RefusalRate is 0.0-0.5% for all transfer configurations, at or below the No Defense baseline (0.5-1.9%). No utility collapse. Criterion 3 (Compute Amortization): 3.1→3 uses 0 GPU-hours (295s CPU only, 285x speedup). 3→3.1 uses ~0.12 GPU-hours (55 min total with 1 GPU, ~133x speedup vs 16 GPU-hours for full optimization). No backpropagation through the LLM backbone in either case.",
  "reason": "All three success criteria are met for both transfer directions. (1) Gap-closed ratio exceeds 0.85 in both directions (1.01 and 0.98), surpassing the strong success threshold. (2) RefusalRate remains at 0.0-0.5%, well within the acceptable range. (3) Compute savings are 2 orders of magnitude (133-285x). The directional asymmetry (3→3.1 requiring tiny-adapt) is an informative finding that does not diminish effectiveness — the lightweight adaptation (200 steps, 20,480 parameters, 7 minutes on 1 GPU) fully resolves it. The method outperforms all prompting baselines in both directions and matches or exceeds the Full DefensiveTokens defense."
