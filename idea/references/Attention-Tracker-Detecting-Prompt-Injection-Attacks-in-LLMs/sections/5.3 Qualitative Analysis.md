5.3 Qualitative Analysis
In this section we visualize the distribution of attention aggregation for important heads in both normal and attack data. Using a grammar correction task and an ignore attack as examples Figure 4 illustrates that the attack data significantly reduces attention on the instruction and shifts focus to the injected instruction. For further qualitative analysis please refer to Appendix A.5[ref_id]A1.SS5.
