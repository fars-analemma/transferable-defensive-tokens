### response:
HackAPrompt ~\cite{b40} is a crowd-sourced dataset of prompt injections collected during a prompt hacking competition. The competition involved 10 levels of difficulty, each adding more constraints for the user data. Level 1 represents a generic prompt injection, in which the user has no constraints on the content of their injection. We select the successful injections against the level-1 challenge and randomly sub-sampled 20 of them. Unlike other attack examples, the prompt injections in the HackAPrompt dataset are tailored to the specific instructions in the original challenge. We keep the original instructions in order to maintain the effectiveness of the attacks. We show one example of this injection on the left.
