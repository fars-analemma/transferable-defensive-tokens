Tree-of-Attacks with Pruning
All previous attacks are hand-crafted. In contrast, optimization-based attacks optimize the injection extensively for each sample, which greatly enlarges the attack space. One example is Tree-of-Attacks with Pruning (TAP) ~\cite{b16}. TAP relies on two LLMs, an attacker LLM to craft the adversarial input and a judge LLM to decide whether the attack was successful. TAP was proposed for jailbreaking attacks. To adapt TAP for prompt injection, we rewrite part of the system message and the input prompt to the attacker LLM. The attacker LLM is given a benign prompt and benign data, and asked to generate any injection that will get the target LLM to output the desired response. We eliminate the judge LLM and instead adopt substring matching to score responses, as our evaluation injection is very simple. Below is one TAP attack example. More can be found in Appendix A.
