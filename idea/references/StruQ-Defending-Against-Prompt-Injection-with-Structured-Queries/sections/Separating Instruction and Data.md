Separating Instruction and Data
A structured query is an input to an LLM that consists of two separate parts, a prompt (i.e., instruction) and data. Existing LLMs do not support structured queries. We seek to build a system that can support structured queries. We see three critical research challenges to achieving this: • Security: The system must not, under any conditions, execute instructions that are found in the data part of a structured query. • Utility: The system must maintain close to the same utility and capability as existing LLMs. • Feasible training: The training cost cannot be too large. Training a state-of-the-art LLM from scratch costs millions of dollars. Currently, it is impractical to train an entirely new LLM just for structured queries. Thus, we need a way to build on existing LLM technology.
