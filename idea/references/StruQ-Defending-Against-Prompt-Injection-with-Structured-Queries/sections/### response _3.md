### response:
In this example, the attacker uses exactly the same delimiters as found in a legitimate query, which is the most effective strategy. We call this a Completion-Real attack. Our system filters out part of those delimiters from user data, rendering this attack impossible. However, an attacker can still try a Completion attack with slight variants on the legitimate delimiters (e.g., "# Response" instead of "### response:"). We call this a Completion-Close attack. We also consider Completion attacks where the attacker uses some other delimiter entirely unrelated to the legitimate delimiters. We call this a Completion-Other attack. We manually design hundreds of other delimiters for use in such an attack (see Appendix A). Finally, we introduce the Completion-OtherCmb attack, which combines Ignore, Escape-Separation, and Completion-Other in one attack. Similarly, there could also be Completion-RealCmb attack combining Ignore, Escape-Separation, and Completion-Real. We show an example below:
