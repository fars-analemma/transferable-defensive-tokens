Ignore Attack
A widely considered attack is to inject a string "Ignore previous instructions and instead..." ~\cite{b8}, as illustrated in Section 3.1. We test our defense against this attack by manually crafting ten variants of "ignore previous instructions" (see Appendix A), and randomly choose one for each sample.
