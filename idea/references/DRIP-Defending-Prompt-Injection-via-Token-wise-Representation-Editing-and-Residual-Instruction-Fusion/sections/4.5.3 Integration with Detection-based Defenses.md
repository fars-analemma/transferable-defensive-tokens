4.5.3 Integration with Detection-based Defenses
Detection-based methods such as prompt classifiers~\cite{} offer lightweight defenses that flag suspicious prompts at inference time without modifying the underlying model. We view our method and detection-based defenses as complementary. Detection-based methods are preferable when access to model weights is limited or when rapid deployment is required. However they may be evaded via adaptive or novel prompts~\cite{}. Our approach while requiring finetuning provides deeper robustness by shifting the model’s internal semantics making it inherently less susceptible to injection even when attacks bypass external detectors. A practical deployment strategy might adopt a two-stage paradigm: use detection-based methods as a first-layer filter and adopt our finetuned models in critical components or high-risk applications especially where the cost of failure is high.
