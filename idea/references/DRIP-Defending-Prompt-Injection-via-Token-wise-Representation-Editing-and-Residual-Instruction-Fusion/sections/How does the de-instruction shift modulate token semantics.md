How does the de-instruction shift modulate token semantics?
Representation editing visualization. Figure 7 shows the \ell_{2} norm of latent representation shifts applied to data tokens. The shift is most pronounced near the boundary marking the start of the data segment indicating the model learns to identify role transitions. Notably elevated shifts also occur around phrases attempting to subvert the original task such as “ignore all instructions” “never mind I changed my mind” and “disregard previous instructions” suggesting the shift mechanism captures directive intent cues.
 Attention reallocation. We visualize layer-0 attention using the first generated token as the query and all preceding tokens as keys. The injected instruction span is highlighted with a black box. Relative to the undefended model our model assigns lower attention weights to the injected segment and reallocates attention toward the top-level instruction region. This indicates that the shift suppresses spurious instruction-like cues in the data while reinforcing adherence to the original instruction.

\langle|\text{start\_header\_id}|\rangle\ \text{user}\ \langle|\text{end\_header\_id}|\rangle marks the start of the data segment.
Tokens with the top-10 largest \ell_{2} shifts are highlighted in red; the injected instruction is boxed in black.
DRIP selectively applies stronger shifts to boundary tokens and attention-drifting phrases (e.g., “ignore”, “disregard”).[IMAGE END]
