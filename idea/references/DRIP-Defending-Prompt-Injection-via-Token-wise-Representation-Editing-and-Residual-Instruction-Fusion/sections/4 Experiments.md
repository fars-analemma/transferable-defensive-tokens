4 Experiments
We design extensive experiments to answer the following research questions:
 •
 RQ1 Role separation capability: Can DRIP effectively disentangle instruction from data semantics?
 •
 RQ2 Utility preservation capability: Can DRIP preserve instruction-following utility in benign settings?
 •
 RQ3 Ablation study: What is the impact of each design choice in DRIP?
