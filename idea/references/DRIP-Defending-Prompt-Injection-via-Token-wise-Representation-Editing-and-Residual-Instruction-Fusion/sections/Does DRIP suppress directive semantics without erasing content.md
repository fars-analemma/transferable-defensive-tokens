Does DRIP suppress directive semantics without erasing content?
A crucial challenge in semantic disentanglement is to remove the instruction semantic without discarding their informative content. Figure 5 illustrates such a case: the injected instruction “State the name of river that runs through London” is embedded into the response in a non-imperative form preserving data semantic while avoiding task overwriting. This contrasts with hard filtering or over-suppression seen in prior defenses. Additional examples are present in our demo site~\cite{}.
[IMAGE START] [IMAGE URL: https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2511.00447/assets/figures/we_good/our_succ5.png] Figure 5: On the LHS, the primary task is to rewrite the paragraph with modern language, and the injected task is asking the name of the river that runs through London. DRIP successfully de-instructs the injected task and rewrites it. On the RHS, the injected task is the true top-level instruction, DRIP can successfully answer it.[IMAGE END]
