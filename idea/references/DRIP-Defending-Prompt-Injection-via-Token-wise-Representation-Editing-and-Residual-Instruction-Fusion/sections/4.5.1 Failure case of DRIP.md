4.5.1 Failure case of DRIP
While DRIP suppresses direct execution of injected instructions it may still leak injected content in semantically entangled form. Figure 10[ref_id]A3.F10 shows a case where the task is to write a pun and the injected query is about bed usage. The model avoids direct execution but integrates the concept (“sleep”) into the pun causing a “semantic echo” of the injection. Although this does not override the main task it reflects a remaining entanglement challenge in hard-to-separate semantic contexts.
