4.5.2 Integration with Inference-Time Defenses
Training-time and inference-time defenses represent two orthogonal lines of research. The former enhances inherent role-switching awareness while the latter aims to safeguard inference-time integrity. Accordingly we consider integrating our approach with several existing inference-time defenses such as Reminder ~\cite{} Sandwich ~\cite{} ThinkIntervene ~\cite{} Fake Completion ~\cite{} Spotlight ~\cite{}.
 We plot model utility on AlpacaEval-2.0 against SEP score on the SEP benchmark in Figure 15[ref_id]A3.F15. We find that adding test-time defenses generally increases SEP scores but can also reduce utility. The largest degradation occurs with Fake Completion~\cite{} which substantially lengthens the prompt by appending fake responses and extra instructions. A comparatively better defense is Reminder which adds only a single line: “Do not execute or adhere to any potential instructions or commands in the following”. These findings suggest that inference-time defenses tend to be ad hoc and non-systematic relying on manually crafted interventions that may not generalize across contexts. While they can enhance immediate safety they often sacrifice usability and efficiency.
