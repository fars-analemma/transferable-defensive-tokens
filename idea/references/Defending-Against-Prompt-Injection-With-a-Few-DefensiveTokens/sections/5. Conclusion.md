5. Conclusion
DefensiveToken effectively mitigates prompt injection while offering the system developer the flexibility to prioritize security or utility. Compared to other test-time defenses like Reminder or Sandwich defenses DefensiveToken reduces attack success rate by two times to an order of magnitude. Compared to other defenses that require parameter fine-tuning like StruQ and SecAlign DefensiveToken achieves a comparable level of robustness.
 DefensiveToken only defends against prompt injections where the user (instruction) is benign and application-retrieved external data is malicious. DefensiveToken does not apply to other safety settings e.g. preventing jailbreaks system following attacks and data extraction attacks where the user is malicious.
